## Description

A personal website is a staple for a web developer, especially one looking to make their mark and show off their talents. Not to mention, the ability to create a functional web application within the NextJS framework is a valuable skill.
This project will continue to be updated as my projects, aspirations, and style change and shift throughout my career. This page will be a starting point for people to learn more about me as a programmer.
